# python-api-challenge
Repository for Module 6 Challenge

This repository contains the following files:
WeatherPy: A jupyter notebook which takes API data from OpenWeatherMap. This data is used to select random cities and compare weather statistics based on Latitude. A datframe of this data is saved to cities.csv in the output_data folder.
VacationPy: A jupyter notebook which uses the information saved into the cities.csv and Geoapify API. It narrows the dataframe based on weather conditions and produces a map.
api_keys.py: A file named api_keys.py should be created where the user enters API keys for OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify.
A folder named “output_data”:
	cities.csv : a csv file containing the dataframe created in WeatherPy.
	Figures of the results found in WeatherPy
